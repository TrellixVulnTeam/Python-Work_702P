Subject: Application for a graduate student position


Dear Prof. Liu,

I am Khalid Bin Salahuddin, a recent BSc graduate in Computer Science and Engineering 
from the East West University, Dhaka, Bangladesh (April 2017). I am writing to express
my interest to join Your research group as a graduate (MSc/PhD) student from the fall
(September) of 2018 academic year.  

I took the liberty to familiarize myself with Your scholarly works, and Your current 
research interests in multimedia content processing and communications, wireless mobile
networking, RFID, cloud and big data, online gaming and social networking, and P2P
networking have particularly captured my attention. I read through some of your published
works such as, CrowdTranscoding: Online Video Transcoding
with Massive Viewers (IEEE Transactions on Multimedia, vol. 19, no. 6, pp. 1365-1375, June 2017)
and CrowdNavi: Demystifying Last Mile Navigation with Crowdsourced Driving Information
(IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, vol. 13, no. 2, pp. 771-781, April. 2017)
that depict, investigate and address some of the most intriguing issues of our time. These
topics fall well in line with my current research interests.
